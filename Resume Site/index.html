        <h2>About My Small Obsession</h2>
        <p>I have collected almost every piece of official Valheim merchindise that I want. I put it in a display case and I bought extras to give to my friends who enjoy the game.</p>
        <p>I have a good amount of diffreing items, from shirts to mugs to stickers and even dice towers shaped like the in-game chest.</p>

        <h2>The Items on my shelf</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mugs, Cups and Horns:</strong> I have a few Tankards, some mugs of jokes i the game and the game's logo. I also have a actual drinking horn, not realy from the game but more of viking tradition..</li>
          <li><strong>Tapestries:</strong> I have 3 copies of each of the 4 tapistries and 3 more tapestires are currently up.</li>
          <li><strong>Figurines and Dice:</strong> I have 6 full color weapons from the game, they are made of metal and able to go on a keychain. There's also a dice tower with the viking compass on it, plus it can fold down to a in game chest that can store the small weapons inside.</li>
          <li><strong>Keychains, Necklaces and Shirts:</strong> I have a lot of wearables including 4 shirts that are basically the only shirts I wear in public, I do my laundry often.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Items:</strong> I have a couple other items like patches that I mostly use like coasters. I also have stickers that I put on my phone and computer and there's coins that i'll carry on me sometimes.</li>

          <li>I love my mugs, I use them almost every day and it makes me feel like a stock photo of a guy drinking coffee.</li>
          <li>My shirts are great because they're one of the first articles of clothing that has something i'm intrested in.</li>
          <li>I also enjoy my dice tower because I get to use it during D&D nights.</li>
